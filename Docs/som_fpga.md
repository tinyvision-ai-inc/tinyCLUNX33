# SoM FPGA

The tinyCLUNX33 SoM features the CrossLinkU-NX 33 FPGA, codename LIFCL-33U.

It features an integrated USB2 and USB3 MAC as well as an USB2 and USB3 PHY.

Programming the FPGA is done by writing the bitfile to the [Flash](som_flash.md)
that is attached to it. Upon power on, the FPGA will load it out of the first
512 kBytes.

## Hardware integration

As seen in the [SoM Power](som_power.md) page, the I/O voltage levels of the
FPGA can be adapted through the PVDD pins, which are connected to the VCCIO
pins of the FPGA, controlling the banks voltage level.

## RTL integration

The [RTL Reference Design](rtl_reference_design.md) provides the foundation of
a system, on top of which the application can be implemented.
