# SoM Clocks

The FPGA features two internal oscillators and an internal PLL to further
synthesize a clock signal out of the available sources.

An external Si5351A PLL is responsible for generating the USB reference clock,
as well as one extra clock signals for custom use. Clocks are synthesized out
of a 25 MHz Crystal Oscillator on the SoM.

The Si5351 PLL can be configured over I2C.
Skyworks provides a generator tool to build the table of I2C registers address
and value for a given clock setup.

| Clock                          | Frequency  | Location                 |
|--------------------------------|------------|--------------------------|
| PLL input crystal oscillator   | 25 MHz     | Si5351 input XA, XB      |
| USB REFCLK differential clock  | 60 MHz     | Si5351 output CLK0, CLK1 |
| PLL Extra output clock         | Selectable | Si5351 output CLK2       |
| PLL External input clock       | Selectable | SoM input pin            |
| FPGA high frequency oscillator | 450 MHz    | FPGA fabric              |
| FPGA low power oscillator      | 128 kHz    | FPGA fabric              |
| FPGA GPLL                      | Selectable | FPGA fabric              |

## Hardware integration

The free output clock may be looped back to the external input clock pin, so
that the PLL provides a clock with an arbitrary frequency directly to the FPGA.

It is also possible to use the free output clock pin elsewhere on the project.

It is also possible to provide an external input clock source to the FPGA.

## RTL integration

The FPGA can use the external input clock, routed to its pin `H8`, which is
a primary clock pin (PCLK), useable for DDR I/O.

TODO: Hook an I2C core and integrate into the core SoM design

## Zephyr integration

TODO: Integrate the clock tree definition into a Device Tree.

TODO: Write a driver to initialize the PLL and control free clock signal.
